                    Wildlife refers to all the animals and plants living in their natural habitats without human
                    influence. It includes a vast range of creatures, from tiny insects to large mammals, and the
                    various plants they depend on for survival. Wildlife plays a crucial role in maintaining ecosystems
                    and contributes to the balance of nature.

                <div class="cardtext">
                    Wildlife is incredibly important for maintaining the balance and health of nature in numerous ways:
                    <ol type="1">
                        <li>
                            Biodiversity: Wildlife comprises a wide array of species, each playing a unique role in the
                            ecosystem.
                            <!-- Biodiversity ensures resilience against environmental changes and enhances ecosystem
                            stability. -->

                            <li value="2">
                                Ecological Balance: Animals and plants interact in intricate ways. They contribute to
                                nutrient cycles, regulate populations of other species (predator-prey relationships),
                                and help in pollination and seed dispersal, maintaining a balanced ecosystem.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Economic Value: Many industries rely on wildlife for economic gains, including tourism,
                                agriculture (pollinators), pharmaceuticals (medicinal plants), and research (studying
                                animal behavior, genetics).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Cultural Significance: Wildlife holds cultural and spiritual value in many societies.
                                Animals and plants often have symbolic significance and are part of traditions, stories,
                                and rituals.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Environmental Indicators: Changes in wildlife populations or habitats can indicate
                                broader environmental issues. For instance, declining bee populations can signal
                                problems with ecosystem health and agricultural productivity.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Natural Resource Management: Wildlife helps manage natural resources like forests,
                                controlling insect populations or aiding in seed dispersal, contributing to overall
                                ecosystem health.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Aesthetic and Recreational Value: Many people find joy, relaxation, and inspiration in
                                observing and appreciating wildlife. National parks and reserves exist not only for
                                conservation but also for people to connect with nature.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        Conservation efforts are crucial to protect wildlife and their habitats, ensuring that these
                        invaluable contributions to nature and human well-being persist for future generations.

                    <p>Scientists from Israel and neighbouring Arab countries are working together to protect Red Sea coral reefs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Around the world, warmer seas are disrupting delicate reef ecosystems, forcing coral to eject the algae that lives on them, turning them white. This “bleaching” destroys a critical part of the food chain, and turns reefs into barren underwater deserts. It’s thought that by 2030 more than half of the Earth’s reefs could be under threat.

                    </p>    
                        
                    <p>
                        The scientists from countries including Israel, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Yemen are setting up a study centre in Switzerland to collaborate on solutions to the Red Sea’s most pressing problems.

                    <p>
                        Sustained conservation efforts in the Virunga Massif in East Africa has seen mountain gorilla numbers rise from 480 in 2010 to 604 in 2016. This brings the total number of mountain gorillas worldwide to over 1,000.

                    <p>
                        Around 40 years ago, bald eagle numbers dwindled across the US and sightings became extremely rare, celebrated events. America’s national symbol was on the verge of extinction, with little hope of recovery. Illegal shooting, pesticide contamination, and degradation and destruction of their habitat all played a role in the bald eagle’s decline. By 1963, only 487 nesting pairs remained.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since then we’ve taken huge strides to bring the bald eagle back from the brink. In 1972, DDT, the harmful pesticide contaminating their food, was banned in the US. 1973 saw the introduction of the Endangered Species Act, which helped protect the bald eagle in particular. In the 1980s, a series of recovery plans were set in motion across the US, and by 1995 the bald eagle had moved from the endangered species list to the threatened list.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The bald eagle was removed from the list of threatened species on 9 August 2007.

                    <p>
                        By the 1970s, brown pelicans had all but disappeared from the US. Suffering a similar fate to the bald eagle, the inclusion of the pesticide DDT in their food chain caused problems such as the thinning of eggshells which made chicks harder to rear.

                        They were granted much-needed protection by the Endangered Species Act. By 1980, rehabilitation efforts were well underway, and 1,276 pelicans were manually reintroduced into Louisiana.

                        In 1985, the brown pelican population was stable enough to remove them from the endangered species list, and in 2007 over 24,000 fledglings were counted in Louisiana alone.
